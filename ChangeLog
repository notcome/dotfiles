  in the background, an audio message is played to notify the user.

  Add "bootstrap.sh"

  Most tools in this repo are expected to be written in Fish and Haskell
  (via Turtle). The bootstrap script set ups the required environment. It

  * installs Homebrew,
    * Xcode command line tools are automatically installed during the process.
  * installs Fish via Homebrew,
  * installs Stack.
    * We will delay "stack setup" until first Haskell package is used.
      This could give us better control over which LTS is used.
      In the future, we can specify a LTS file in the repo.
