  Add "bootstrap.sh"

  Most tools in this repo are expected to be written in Fish and Haskell
  (via Turtle). The bootstrap script set ups the required environment. It

  * installs Homebrew,
    * Xcode command line tools are automatically installed during the process.
  * installs Fish via Homebrew,
  * installs Stack.
    * We will delay "stack setup" until first Haskell package is used.
      This could give us better control over which LTS is used.
      In the future, we can specify a LTS file in the repo.
